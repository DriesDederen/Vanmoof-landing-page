# VanMoof Landing Page
*NOTE: This is for educational purposes.*

I am currently learning and mastering CSS and HTML. I was looking at YouTube videos where people code landing pages of companies. As I am a very big fan of the VanMoof bikes, and I was looking for some project to make, I really had to make the landing page of this company.

Was really nice to make this project!
